### Project Goal

The subject of racing car setups is both expansive and complex.  Creating a setup which is both fast and easy to drive can be both time-consuming and frastrating.  For those new to car setups or sim-racing generally, the options can seem overwhelming, and the effects of each setting difficult to understand. 

The main aim of the site is to give users a quick and efficient way to find pre-made, fast and easy-to-handle car setups for the game and car of their choice.  Users can also submit their own setups for use by other racers.

And for those wanting to learn more, a `'tutorials'` section is included, with links to various YouTube videos submitted by fellow sim-racers.

### User Stories:

 * As a first-time user I want the site to be intuitive and easy to navigate and understand.  

 * As a user I want a simple, quick method of finding a good setup for my car. 

 * As a user I want the site to be elegant and easy on the eye.

 * As a user I want the site to be responsive to different screen sizes so that I can still use the site whether Iâ€™m using my mobile phone, tablet or PC.

 * As an experienced sim-racer I want an easy way to submit setups I've created.

 * As an experienced sim-racer I want a way to edit setups I've created previosuly.  
 
 * As a returning user I want my setups to be protected from interference by other users.

 * As a user new to sim-racing I'm interested in learning how to set up my own cars. A`'setup-guide'`section would therefore be very valuable.

## Automated testing

Screen responsiveness testing was carried out using Google Chrome's Developer Tools to ensure correct page loading on multiple devices including various mobile phone and tablet sizes.

### W3C Validator Tools

[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) tool used to validate HTML code. A number of errors were raised in relation to Table Columns on the 'Find Setups' page, however the same code is used within the 'My Setups' page and does not produce any table errors so has been difficult to resolve thus far.

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) tool used to validate CSS style code. Code was found to be free of errors.

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) used to verify Javascript coding (is unable to verfiy jQuery sections however).  Code was found to be free of errors, although there is very little Javascript or jQuery used within this project.

[Extends Class](https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html) used to verify Python Code.  The code was found to be free of errors.

## Manual Testing

* Site loads as expected on Motorola mobile phone device utilising the Android operating system, running the Chrome browser. 

* Site loads as expected on a PC utilising the Windows operating system.  Tested using Chrome, Firefox and Edge.  All load correctly and function identically.  

* Responsiveness :
  - The site is responsive to all break points and works as expected.
  - The site responds well to device rotation and resizes as expected.

* Navbar Links:
  - All links function correctly across Mobile, Tablet and Desktop sizes.
* Home Page 'card' links:
  - Four 'cards' within the main section of the Home Page present the user with the main options for the site. Each card bears one link. Each link was found to be responding well on all screen sizes and across multiple browsers and a Motorola mobile phone running the Android operating system.
* Filter Boxes:
  - Filter selectors for sims, cars and tracks all function as intended with swift response times. Results Tables are generated quickly and render as designed.  The only small problem found was with iPad size Table output where the 'Edit', 'View' and 'Delete' buttons, whcich should be side by side, are rendering such that the 'Delete' button is below the first two buttons. This will need to addressed in the next update.
* Register and Login buttons:
  - The buttons, located on both the Home Page and the respective Register and Login pages work efficiently and as intended on all screen sizes and without issue.
* Logout button
  - The Navbar button was tested on multiple pages across by PC and mobile devices and found to be highly responsive and working as intended.
* View, Edit and Delete buttons within Setup 'Results' tables:
  - The various buttons found with the 'Find Setup', 'My Setups' and 'Manage Setups' screens were all found to be working as intended with excellent responses times and full functionality with regards to displayed results and updates to database information in respect of setup edits.  The 'Delete' buttons, similarly, were found to correctly result in records being deleted from the database.
* Admin Tasks section:
  - The Admin Tasks button within the Navbar was found to appear only when a user with Admin Rights was logged in. This as intended.
  - The 'Manage Setups' button was found to be functioning correctly and efficiently. As stated previously, the Manage Setups results Table and filter section function correctly and in a swift and pleasing manner.
  - All buttons within the section were found to function as intended.
  - The 'Manage Users - Edit' button on Mobile devices was found to return the user to the 'Home Page'.  This has been rectified and is now functioning as intended.
  - The 'Edit Users' page was found to be responsive and and accept requests to check for existing users and an Admin password. Upon submission of the updated user details, however, the new details were found not have been saved to the database. This bug will need to be rectified for the next update.
  - The 'Manage Users - Delete' button was found to work as expected, with records being rmoved from the database as intended.
* Footer Links :
  
    - Facebook - When selecting the Facebook icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Facebook website. It worked as expected.
    - Twitter -  When selecting the Twitter icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Twitter website. It worked as expected.
    - YouTube - When selecting the YouTube icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the YouTube website. It worked as expected.
    - Instagram -  When selecting the Instagram icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Instagram website. It worked as expected.

# 5. Development Cycle
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Initial development of the site began with pen and paper and a basic outline of the pages required.  
Inspiration was drawn both from my own keen interest in sim racing, and from Code Institutes own  'Task Manager' project found with the Full Stack Developer study materials.

To give a little variety to the project I decided initally to create two or three of the main page wireframes and then create the code for those pages before moving on to any further wireframe design. With hindsight, it may have been slightly more efficient to thoroughly desing everything in advance, but been less artisticly inclined than coding inclined, I felt it necessary to combime and blend the two disciplines to avoid any risk of running out of steam or enthusiasm.

Wireframes in place, and with a few interesting pictures downloaded from Pexels the coding took shape fairly quickly to begin with. With the Home, Login and Register pages in places, the next phase of design was the Submit Setups page.

This phase of the project presented some sizeable challenges, due mainly to the quantity of individual data points required to create a car setup (50+ in most cases). Manually hard coding the 'get requests' for such a high number of inputs was impractical. It therefore became apparent that the parameters for each sim would have to be stored in, and be generated from the database.  Creating the necessary requests via 'Flask', first to the filter section to extract the sim name, then to the database to retrieve the related cars and tracks, Headings and Parameters for the sim in question left me scatching my head for more than a few days.  The intricacies of Flask only becoming apparent as the days ticked on and I struggled to get to grips with the logic. In the end, the 'Submit Page' actually turned into three pages with the first giving input to the second, and the second to the third.

Evemtually it started to click into place, and with a little encouragement and pointers in the right direction from my mentor, the main bulk of the project began to fall into place.  With the 'Submit Setups' page complete, the 'Find Setups' and 'My Setups' pages took shape fairly quicky, having the same basic structure and logic as the Submit Page section.

The final 'coding' phase of the project was to construct the 'Admin Tasks' section - accsessible only by users with 'Admin Rights'.  This was relatively straightforward in comparison with the 'setups' section, with the 'Manage Setups' part based heavily on the 'Edit', 'View' and 'Delete' functions built previously for the 'Find Setups' and 'My Setups' pages.

The only fly in the ointment is the 'Edit Users' section which to date works very nicely except for the fact that it doesn't save the updated details entered by the Admin User.  This will need to be ironed out prior to a future update.

With all that in place it remained only to improve the Home Page imagery and tidy up the styling a little and the site was complete.

  - 'Edit user' function allows an Admin User to find, select and update the details of any user in the system.  The changes are not saved to the database however, despite a 'Flash' message confirming the details have been updated.
  - Within 'Tablet' screensizes, the initial 'My Setups' and 'Manage Setups' pages, the results table provides three action buttons (Edit, View and Delete), which should line up side by side.  The Delete button is displayed below the the Edit and View buttons however.
